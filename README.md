# Orbital-Mechanics-Exercises
This repository contains six simples Python codes for the solving of orbital mechanics related problems. In particular, you can find several functions for the integration of orbits in both the unperturbed and the perturbed two body problems, the computation parameters, and computation of ground tracks. Finally all the results have been plotted and shown here.
