# Orbital-Mechanics-Exercises

Simple Python codes solving exercises from the Politecnico di Milano's course Orbital Mechanics. In this repository you can find 6 exercises, divided in 2 laboratories, covering the following problems:
- Orbit integration in the Unperturbed 2 Body Problem (U2BP) and computation of the variation of the orbit's parameters. 
- Orbit integration in the Perturbed 2 Body Problem under J2 (J22BP) and computation of the variation of the orbit's parameters. 
- Solver for Keplerâ€™s equation.
- Computation of ground track under the U2BP and the J22BP.
